Assumptions: Student does not have repeating course id’s in their “courses taken before”. 
Students who are not placed into their choices will not be placed into any other course as we are 
assuming that they do not want to. Also, we are assuming that if a student did not a 2nd or 3rd choice,
 it is because they are lazy and we are penalizing their priority for it. 

Instructions: 
Simply enter “ruby Scheduler.rb” into the terminal. Make sure the input files are “student_pref.csv” 
and “course_constraints.csvv” and the output file is “students.csv”

Limitations: Did not implement any user input. Was not able to create the csv file for the courses. 
Was not able to say whether a course could run or not. Sometimes does not give reason for why student was not placed into classses

Changes: I was able to create the 2d arrays that were needed to place the students inside of the
 classes. I was able to get the functionality of the program working and enroll students into 
 courses and track all of the information. I was able to create an output csv file for students and
  give the data of the courses’ through terminal. I fixed the code to be more modular and easier to read. Fixed a lot of bugs that I had found along the way. Proper commented and documented code.
